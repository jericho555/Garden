## Garden Monitoring Tool Based on Computer Vision and Machine Learning

This project focuses on monitoring gardens using computer vision and machine learning techniques. We evaluated traditional machine learning methods against deep learning approaches to detect and classify various garden elements, such as plant health, pest presence, and soil conditions. 

### Features:
- **Data Collection:** Images and environmental data from garden sites.
- **Computer Vision Analysis:** Detection of plants, pests, and anomalies using image processing.
- **Machine Learning Evaluation:** Comparative analysis of traditional machine learning algorithms versus deep learning models for accuracy and performance.
- **Dashboard Visualization:** Insights displayed on an interactive dashboard for real-time garden monitoring and decision-making.

### Highlights:
- Enhanced garden management through AI-driven analysis.
- Insights into the effectiveness of machine learning versus deep learning methods.
- Scalable solution adaptable to different garden environments.
