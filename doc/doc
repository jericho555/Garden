## Overview
The Garden Monitoring Tool is a computer vision and machine learning project aimed at automating crop identification and assessing the presence of grass in a garden. The tool provides efficient monitoring, quick assessment of crop health, and helps maintain a healthy garden environment. The project includes two tasks: Task 1 using traditional machine learning techniques and Task 2 utilizing deep learning and transfer learning approaches.

## Key Features
- Automatic crop identification in garden images or videos
- Detection and assessment of grass presence
- Comparative analysis of traditional machine learning vs. deep learning approaches
- Performance evaluation metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
